# Graphics_Showcase
Hi!

Disclaimer: I have only edited the two documents outside of the zip file.
The zip contains a graphics library that my teacher designed. (Here's the course page: https://jimfix.github.io/csci385/index.html )
A future iteration of this project may depend only on the internal javascript libraries,
but we're not there quite yet!

To run this program and check out all the cool stuff I've made, first download all the files and uncompress the zip. 
Then open up the html link. It should take you to a page where you can see a bunch of cool 3d shapes.
Go through them with the number keys or by pressing the buttons on the screen. 
You can change their appearance with those buttons, and move them around by dragging them with your mouse.
